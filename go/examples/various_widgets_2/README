A go.mod is needed, which might look something like:

```
module various_widgets_2

go 1.24.1

require github.com/gradgrind/minion_gui v0.0.0

replace github.com/gradgrind/minion_gui v0.0.0 => ../..
```

The last line is to substitute a local repository. Depending on where this example is run,
the path would need changing.
