Unpack the FLTK source code here, to produce the directory fltk-1.4.3 (or whatever the latest version is). Rename this directory to fltk-src.

Build dependencies on Ubuntu (24.04) should be something like:

libpango1.0-dev
libwayland-cursor++1
libwayland-client++1
libwayland-dev
wayland-protocols
libxkbcommon-dev
libxinerama-dev
libxcursor-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
libegl-dev
libdbus-1-dev

To build:

./fltkbuild.sh

Note that FLTK needs to be built with the additional option -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON because it is to be incorporated into a dynamic library.
